## 2026-05-30 — Import

Imported `prd-security-bugfix.md` from research to backlog. Extracted 5 tasks
across 3 phases (Authorization, Fetch Hardening, Auth Hardening) from US-001..US-005
and FR-1..FR-10.

All PRD-referenced files confirmed present:
- internal/handlers/resource_crud.go, utils.go, auth.go
- internal/services/resource/service.go
- internal/security/ssrf.go

Existing security tests confirmed present (extend rather than replace):
- internal/handlers/{auth_security,resource_security,utils_security,auth_oauth_security}_test.go
- internal/security/ssrf_test.go
- internal/services/resource/service_test.go

Open questions carried into task notes (1.2 org edit roles, 2.1 size limit default,
3.1 Goth verified-email exposure).

## 2026-05-30 — Open questions resolved

- 1.2 (org roles): org MEMBERS can edit/version/retry/reset-webhook; deletion owner-only.
- 2.1 (size limit): single shared 1 MiB limit (1<<20) for all fetched files;
  io.LimitReader(r, maxBytes+1) to distinguish exactly-at-limit from oversized.
- 3.1 (OAuth verified email): investigated goth v1.82.0. No verified-email signal
  for GitHub (Verified flag only used internally in getPrivateMail fallback, not
  surfaced on User or RawData) or GitLab (/api/v4/user email only, no confirmed flag).
  Ramble configures only github + gitlab providers (auth.go:65-67). Google would
  expose email_verified via RawData but is not configured.
  DECISION: remove silent email-based linking at auth.go:93-94; match only on
  (provider, providerID). Same-email collisions return a clear "log in and link
  explicitly" error.

PATTERN: oauth-security - goth's generic User struct carries no verified-email flag;
do not treat gothUser.Email as a trusted identity for account linking.
